        Dcoument the Kubernetes deployment process.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

Kubernetes deployment

    Progress has been slow.
    The aim is to have the same helm chart deployment that works at all three locations.

    Reliability issues at Somerville.
    The StackHPC Helm charts are easy to use when they work.
    If they don't work, they can be impossible to debug.
    Combination of templating in Helm and wait-retry in ClusterAPI mean it can just sit there in a loop.
    No error messages in the logs, just creating and deleting resources.
