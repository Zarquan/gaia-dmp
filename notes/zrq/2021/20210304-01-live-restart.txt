    Email from Nigel:

        Subject: Gaia IRIS platform live system zombified?

        Well it’s happened again. Trying to re-execute a cell in Zeppelin that took 5min first time around, and now it’s gone into navel-gazing mode again:
        while nothing is showing up in the application UI apart from the first stage (successfully completed 37 csv file reads apparently):
        and what’s more there’s nothing recent in the relevant file system, and something weird akin to a stale NFS handle (I know it’s ceph):

        Is it because I’m trying to overwrite I wonder… anyway if you have time to have a look at anything under the hood that you can see then
        let me know and I’ll kill everything that I can from my side, scrub the existing folder and try again.

    Target:

        Restart the Zeppelin and Spark processes on the live deployment.

    Result:

        Zeppelin and Yarn restarted ...
