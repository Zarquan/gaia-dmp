        Create a set of cclake* flavors that start at just under 1/2 the size of a CascadeLake hypervisor,
        so that 2 instances will just about fit into one hypervisor and then step down in half sizes to
        1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 and 1/64 of the hypervisor.

        * cumulus_gaia_cclake_54vcpu - 54vcpu, 92G mem, 20+420G disc
        * cumulus_gaia_cclake_26vcpu - 26vcpu, 45G mem, 20+200G disc
        * cumulus_gaia_cclake_12vcpu - 12vcpu, 22G mem, 20+90G disc
        * cumulus_gaia_cclake_6vcpu - 6vcpu, 10G mem, 20+35G disc
        * cumulus_gaia_cclake_2vcpu - 2vcpu, 4G mem, 25G disc
        * cumulus_gaia_cclake_1vcpu - 1vcpu, 2G mem, 12G disc

        This would enable us to create combinations of sizes that will fit together to make the best use of the available resources.

    The smallest two sizes were added as 20G local disc plus ephermeral, rather than just local disc.
    This meant that these flavors would not fit the available resources.
    My bad - I should have made this explicit, either in the text or by creating a full pull request.

        54vcpu, 26vcpu, 12vcpu and 6vcpu flavors produced less nodes than expected because
        the requested disc space was calculated based on 880 rather than 830.

        2vcpu produced less nodes than expected because
            spread sheet has 20G local      834/20=41.7
            flavor originally had 20+25G    834/45=18.5
            flavor updated to 25 local      834/25=33.3
            * these figures don't match up with the tests
            * tests run with either the old or new flavor sizes wouldn't match the calculated values in the spread sheet

        1vcpu produced less nodes than expected because
            spread sheet has 20G local      834/20=41.7
            flavor originally had 20+12G    834/32=26.0

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Third change

    Start again, using more up to date figures for disc space.
    Value in Paul's spread sheet is 830G, round that down to 800 to leave lots of space.

    New issue and new PR

    Update the Cascade lake flavors for Gaia #71
    https://github.com/RSE-Cambridge/cumulus-config/issues/71

        Update the Cascade lake flavors for Gaia based on new information on the available disc space
        (assumed 880G, actual is 830G). Rounding the numbers up/down achieve the best available fit.

        The aim is to create a set of cclake* flavors that start at just under 1/2 the size of a CascadeLake
        hypervisor, so that 2 instances will just about fit into one hypervisor and then step down in half
        sizes to 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 and 1/64 of the hypervisor.

        Fix for issue #71, update the Gaia Cascade lake flavors to achieve the best fit following resource tests.
