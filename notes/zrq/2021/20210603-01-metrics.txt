    ssh  -L '3000:monitor:3000' fedora@zeppelin

    # This doesn't go anywhere .. the ansibler Pod isn't exposing port 3000.

# Add a new Data Source

    # From Stelios's notes :

        # Click on button "Data Sources: Add your first data source"

        # Select Prometheus as the Data source

        # In the Prometheus data source create form, set the url to: http://monitor:9090

# Add a new Dashboard

    # From Stelios's notes :

        # We can import dashboards to monitor cpu/mem & disk usage on our nodes using any of the templates found at:
        # https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/

        # Try one of the most popular Dashboards for Node Exporter metrics:
        # https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11074

        # To use this just copy the ID (11074) and navigate to (+ / Import) on the left menubar and paste into the textfield.
        # In the next screen, set the VictoriaMetrics to the Prometheus Data source we created earlier, and click "Import"

        # Success, we see a number of panels with metrics for Cpu, Memory etc..

    # Limited success.
    # We can see lots of panels for cpu, memory and disc IO etc.
    # Problem is the discs we are interested in don't show up.
    # Needs more work to get usefl diagnoistics ...
