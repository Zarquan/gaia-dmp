    Target:

        Success

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Several different configurations found the same limit.
    Total 972 vcpu

    Cambridge claim we have 1200 vcpus, but I can't find them.

    Physical hardware.
    Start with our original machines.

        110 vcpu
        188G memory
        < 360G DAS

    972/110=8.8..

    Looks like ~9 machines ?

    I think we are 'gaia'
    There is also 'gaia-core' which looks like Cambridge processing ?
    gaia-dev, gaia-test, gaia-prod are old allocations on Cumulus.

    Allocation is 795

    Use is ~500 for 2023
        high 652
        low 303

    Average core useage by site 12k
    Average core useage by activity 12k
