    How do I add and remove users from the live systems without having to do a redeploy?

        https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/master/notes/zrq/20230704-01-new-users.txt
        https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/master/notes/stv/20240228-new-user.txt

    How do I backup user data and notebooks?

        Backup notebooks live->data and live->offsite
        https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/master/notes/zrq/20230123-01-backup-notebooks.txt
        https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/master/notes/zrq/20230323-01-backup-notebooks.txt
        https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/master/notes/zrq/20230517-01-backup-notebooks.txt

        Backup notebooks live->offsite AND secrets data->offsite
        https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/master/notes/zrq/20230912-03-backups.txt

    Relatioship between data and the other projects ?

        Data VM contains the SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt
            Check with Stelios for details on these.

        Data VM contains the secrets, including the DuckDNS token
            Used to updated the IP address of colours, and live.

        Data VM contains the passhashes
            Used to populate the MariaDB database table for Zepelin accounts.

        Data VM contains the backup of the notebooks
            /var/local/backups/notebooks

            New deploy will copy notebooks from data

            It is up to us to pull a new backup from live->data manually.
            We _could_ have a cron job on data that pulled backups.

        Data project holds the home shares for live users
        Data project holds the user shares for live users
        Data project holds the science data shares

        These are all mounted via kernel mount entries in /etc/fstab in each VM.
            https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/master/deployments/hadoop-yarn/bin/cephfs-mount.sh
            https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/master/deployments/hadoop-yarn/ansible/51-cephfs-mount.yml

    How do I change the “live” gaia dns to point at green,blue,red respectively?

        Use the DuckDNS token from secrets to update the live.

    Point me at a list of known issues or a troubleshooting guide.

        Cambridge CepFS mounts
            cephfs mount fails
            shares stuck in deleting
            openstack is foobar


    Discuss the best way to resolve the versions issue that’s preventing deploying the current main branch, as this will presumably be the first issue for me to resolve

        Check with Stelios.

    TODO

    Go through a checklist that I’m on all the necessary mailing lists and have access to everything I should have access to.


    Go through Resource request details
        email in to with deniza
        summary of where we are
        details of next year's allocation
