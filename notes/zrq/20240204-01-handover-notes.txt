Build scripts

    delete-all - deletes *everything* in the selected Openstack project.
        sanity-check
            compares the host name with the current live system, just in case
        deletes *all* the components
        compensates for bad tools leaving orphanned components behind

    create-all

        create network, subnet and router
        create VMs
            zeppelin, master, workers
            deployments/hadoop-yarn/ansible/config/zeppelin-54.86-spark-6.26.43.yml

        install software

        create ceph router
        deployments/hadoop-yarn/bin/cephfs-router.sh

        mount data shares
        deployments/hadoop-yarn/bin/mount-data-shares.sh
            foreach share in datashares.yaml
                deployments/hadoop-yarn/bin/cephfs-mount.sh
                    ansible-playbook \
                        51-cephfs-mount.yml
                            hosts: zeppelin:masters:workers

        NOT USED
        deployments/hadoop-yarn/bin/mount-user-shares.sh

        NOT USED
        deployments/hadoop-yarn/ansible/37-install-gaiaxpy.yml

        NOT USED
        deployments/hadoop-yarn/ansible/config/users.yml
        deployments/hadoop-yarn/ansible/60-user-logins.yml (commented in create-all.yml)
        deployments/hadoop-yarn/ansible/62-create-linux-user.yml
        deployments/hadoop-yarn/bin/create-users.sh

Refactoring
Do this before we try to explain it.
This may break some of the older notes, but we can cope with that.
Do we update the notes at the same time ?

    split agclient into 2
        ansi-client
        kube-client


    what is this for ?
    deployments/hadoop-yarn/bin/create-all.sh
        hostname="${3:-zeppelin.gaia-dmp.uk}"


    move
        experiments
        => deployments/attic/experiments

        deployments/kubernetes
        => deployments/attic/kubernetes

        deployments/cluster-api
        => deployments/kubernetes

        deployments/zeppelin/bin
        => deployments/admin/bin
            admin shell scripts - not zeppelin
            need to update the call paths
                create-cephfs-share
                create-user-tools
                zeppelin-rest-tools

        deployments/zeppelin/test/config
            stays where it is
