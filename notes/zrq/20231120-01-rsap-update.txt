    Target:

        Update our RSAP request following comments from Deniza Chekrygina at STFC UKRI.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

Thank you for submitting a resource request to IRIS for the allocation round for 2024/25. It contains almost all the requested information concerning your future hardware needs. However, I have some comments:

1.  There is a bit of a mismatch of information provided for the GAIA Core Processing (CP) and GAIA Data Mining (DM) platform.
    For example, for CP 3.1.1A it says allocated, while in 3.1.2A for DM –provided.
    For storage for the former, it says TB; for the latter, it says TiB.
    For the CPU CP uses physical cores, and DM uses virtual cores.
    This can be a bit confusing for reviewers to follow.

2.  In the table in 4.1.2, can you please specify if the RAM for each core or for all cores is shown in the CPU column?

3.  In section 5 you are writing that the request is for additional resources;
    however, in 5.1 mention reducing your request from the currently allocated.
    Can you please clarify?
    Having read 5.1, I assume that the numbers in Table 5.1A are for the total request.

4.  I might have missed it, but I couldn’t find anything discussing DM requests at different providers.
    There is some mention of storage for DR4 but not the CPU request.
    Perhaps some information can be added to the computation model section of the document?

5.  Can you please confirm that in 5.2 you are requesting 2800 virtual cores in total
    and not in addition to the current 700 virtual cores?
    Your long-term forecast shows 2800 virtual cores as a total request for DM for the next three years.

    How do we check to see if we should use TB or TiB ?

    Compare what Openstack metadata says compared to actual disc space.
