    Target:

        Plans of whast to do next ...

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    User accounts

        Create Ceph shares

        if uuid is null

            uid/name + size + type -> create share => uuid
            uid/name chmod and chown

        if uuid is not null

            locate uuid

                get access codes

                name + uuid -> mount the share /user/<name> (/data/<name>)







# -----------------------------------------------------

    'gardening' tasks to be handled in a new branch.

        Remove verbose JSON from Ansible task.
        Possibly re-instate something simpler later.

            export ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=ansible.posix.json


        Add DR3 symlinks to the build.

        Remove unused test share
        https://github.com/wfau/aglais/issues/841

# -----------------------------------------------------

    'refactoring' tasks to be handled in a new branch.

        Move exsiting /data/ to /data/gaiadmp

        Move /user/<name> to /data/<name>

    How soon can we do this ?
    Is it too late to do this ?
    What is the cost, how conflicting is /user ?
    No one has noticed yet, so possibly not that important ?
