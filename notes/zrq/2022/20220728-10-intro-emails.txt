Dear <researcher>

Welcome to the GaiaDMp project.

Your new account has been created

    User name :
    Pass phrase :

The front page shows a folder of public example notebooks and a folder for your own notebooks.

The public examples demonstrate how to do a range of different analyses methods using the Gaia data. These will be updated and extended by the Gaia DNp team as we learn more.

We have set the permissions to enable you to open the editor view and see the code for each cell. We ask you not to modify the public examples themselves, as these are a shared resource.

Each user is given a folder under "/Users" for your own notebooks. To get you started we have included a copy of all the example notebooks for you to experiment with. Feel free to edit, modify or delete your copy of the examples, they are yours to do with as you please. When we develop new examples we will publish them in the Public Examples folder. It will be up to you to clone the new examples into your personal folder.

Each user is given 2 directories on the file-system for their own use.

Each user gets a standard 1Gbyte home directory, "/home/{username}", which you can use to store private information like passwords and authentication tokens. No one else can access the files in your home directory.

Each user is also given 10Gbytes of space on the shared file-system at /user/{username}, which is for storing results of your analyses. Please be aware in order to make this space accessible from the Spark workers this directory is not protected.

You can use this shared space to save the results from a Spark DataFrame using the save functions.
https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-load-save-functions.html

For example, to save the results of the query in example 3. "Source counts over the sky" you could add the following Python code in a cell after the SQL query.

%pyspark
# Write the results to disc ..
df.write.save(
    "file:///user/DMorris/my-first-results"
    )

Note the "file:///..." prefix (with three /'s) is needed to direct the Spark DataFrame to write to the correct location in the shared file-system. This will create a directory called "my-first-results" and write the contents of the DataFrame as a set of Parquet files.

Everyone starts with an initial allocation of 10Gbytes, but we are happy to expand this as needed. If you need more space please contact us at the support email address, <gaiadmp-support@roe.ac.uk>, and we will be happy to increase your quota.

Have fun experimenting. If you have any issues please contact us via the support email address, <gaiadmp-support@roe.ac.uk>, and we will help you resolve it.

Cheers,
-- Dave Morris
