    Three levels of analysis
    
        Mean proper motions
        http://zeppelin.aglais.uk:8080/#/notebook/2G748GZSW

            zeppelin-14.45-spark-4.14.45.yml
        
        Random Forrest classifier of astrometric solutions
        http://zeppelin.aglais.uk:8080/#/notebook/2G5NU6HTK
        
            zeppelin-27.45-spark-4.27.45.yml
        
        Kinematic analysis using HDBSCAN
        http://zeppelin.aglais.uk:8080/#/notebook/2GGTT4U7N

            zeppelin-55.90-spark-6.27.45.yml

            Are we wasting cores ?
            Does the Zeppelin node run more than a few threads ?
            Is HDBSCAN parallel ?            
            If not, then zeppelin-4.90 might be sufficient ?
            Would it make sense to request large memoiry nodes ?
            The Gaia workers had 256G of memory, in 2020.
            The equivalent in 2022 would be 512G ?
            One Zeppelin node with 500G of memory would not be impossible.
