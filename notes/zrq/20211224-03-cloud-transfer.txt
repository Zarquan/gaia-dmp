    Target:

        s3cmd is very slow
        VM dies a few hours into the transfer - no idea why.

        s4cmd crappy software
        sync operation fails with a stack trace
        Not working, time wasting.

        Try s5cmd ?
        https://github.com/peak/s5cmd

    Result:

        s3cmd is very slow
        s4cmd crappy software
        s5cmd crappy software

# Install the binary.

    tar -xvzf s5cmd_1.4.0_Linux-64bit.tar.gz

    mv s5cmd bin

    which s5cmd

    # I'm assuming both s4cmd and s5cmd work with Amazon.
    # S3 is not a standard
    # S3 is a proprietary service interface, with almost but not quite copies by other projects.
    # Echo is an almost but not quite copy.
