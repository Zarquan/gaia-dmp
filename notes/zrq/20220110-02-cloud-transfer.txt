Hi Paul,

Go for it.

Can we change the names of the projects on the new cloud.

Copies of the Manila shares have been transferred from Cumulus to the iris-gaia-dev project on Arcus. Can we keep this project as-is, but rename it to iris-gaia-data, with a small allocation of general vcpu but all of the big Manila shares.

Then the three big projects from Cumulus, pinned to the specific hardware, but rather than iris-gaia-prod, iris-gaia-test and iris-gaia-dev can we rename them to iris-gaia-red, iris-gaia-green and iris-gaia-blue.

    Cumulus         -> Arcus
    -               -> iris-gaia-data  (Manila shares)
    iris-gaia-prod  -> iris-gaia-red   (pinned)
    iris-gaia-test  -> iris-gaia-green (pinned)
    iris-gaia-dev   -> iris-gaia-blue  (pinned)

Cheers,
-- Dave
