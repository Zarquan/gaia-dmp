    Target:

        Checking the holiday days for 2023.
        People&Money says I took 14 more hours than I should have.

    Result:

        Yep, adding it all up I used 14 more hours than I should have.

        The multi-million pound accounting system allowed me to book 14 more hours than I should have.
        Post Office Horizon ?!

Hi Leigh,

Going back through my calendar I did indeed take 315 hours in 2023.

My recolection is I used the available balance from People&Money to book the dates for November and December.
I assumed the time remaining People&Money showed me was correct, so I booked holiday to use it.

However, it is quite common for our team to work weekends and public holidays.

For example, People&Money automatically allocated Tue 02 Jan 2024 as a holiday,
but the GitHub logs for our project show that I was working.

    Tue 02 Jan 2024 2:21pm
    https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/commit/8cbef6ebd2d77a59adbb5b2b4d827755edaaf965

I didn't request Tue 02 Jan 2024 as a holiday and I didn't realise that
People&Money was counting it as such.

Can you please delete the holiday entry for Tue 02 Jan 2024 and
use the hours to create a new entry for Mon 04 Mar 2024.

Many thanks,
-- Dave
