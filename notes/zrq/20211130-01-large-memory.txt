    High memory node for Dennis.
    Looks like there already is one available.

        cumulus_flavor_general_xlarge:
          name: "general.v1.xlarge"
          vcpus: 28
          ram: 184320
          disk: 20
          ephemeral: 340

        cumulus_flavor_gaia_cclake_55vcpu:
          name: "gaia.cclake.55vcpu"
          vcpus: 55
          ram: 92160
          disk: 20
          ephemeral: 380

    Double the memory of our 55 core node.
    TODO put this in a config and try it.
