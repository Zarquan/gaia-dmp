    Pull request #1266
    https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/pull/1266

    Mostly about refactoring my notes, but it also split the client launch script into two.

    Notes for most of the hadoop-yarn deployments included an explicit call to launch the client container.
    https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/f76f875d6ebeb245e59b6c2028c678188fc3cceb/notes/zrq/20230124-01-test-deploy.txt#L53-L87

        podman run ....

    While working on the cluster-api deployments I started to use /bin/agclient to launch the client container.
    https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/f76f875d6ebeb245e59b6c2028c678188fc3cceb/notes/zrq/20240129-01-jade-test.txt#L42-L52

        agclient jade

    I tried updating /bin/agclient to work on both hadoop-yarn and cluster-api deployments, but they needed different environment variables.
    https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/blob/f76f875d6ebeb245e59b6c2028c678188fc3cceb/notes/zrq/20231027-01-new-deploy.txt#L109-L137

    Better to split it into two scripts, /bin/ansi-client to launch the client for hadoop-yarn deployments,
    and /bin/kube-client to launch the client for cluster-api deployments.

    All is fine, but old notes will refer to /bin/agclient, which no longer exists.
    In 99% of cases assume /bin/agclient means /bin/kube-client, but that 1% of cases mean it isn't safe to symlink.

    This won't be a problem once our current notes become old notes.

    Pull request #1269
    https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/pull/1269

    Moved /experiments to /attic/experiments
    /experiments contained useful code but was never ready for production
    Moved them to /attic to make this clear.

    The /kubernetes deployment was work done in 2020 which was halted while we concentrated on the hadoop-yarn deployment.
    We restarted the work on using kubernetes in 2023, but a lot will have changed.
    Best approach was to start again with the cluster-api deployment and then port the old kubernetes as needed.

    First step is pull request #1269 which moves /deployments/kubernetes to /attic/deployments/kubernetes

    Then we can move /deployments/cluster-api to /deployments/kubernetes when it is appropriate.
    Probably once we have Zeppelin working in the new deployment?
    I'll leave it up to you to decide when.

    Pull request 1273
    https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/pull/1273

    This one has been overdue for a while.
    There are some shell scripts which run in the client container to perform admin tasks.

        creating cehpfs shares
        creating user accounts
        accessing the Zeppelin REST API

    Because of history, they were in a directory called /deployments/zeppelin/bin,
    which suggested the should be run in the Zeppelin node.

    This pull request moved them into /deployments/admin, which is a bit better.
    Possibly /admin/bin might be better, but that can be done later.
