    Monday - start work on shared secret service for Aglais.

        Deploy based on master branch fails the automated tests.
        No details of how they failed, just ERROR.

        The most likely cause is two deployments writing to a shared notebooks
        folder with no controls to prevent overwriting each other's data.

        Unable to diagnose the cause because ..

    Tuesday - failed deployment deleted by mistake.

        Mix up with credentials in local clouds.yml config file caused
        automated deploy to delete and replace deployment on another cloud.

        Easy mistake to make, but cost us time realising what happened
        and means we weren't able to diagnose the cause of test fails
        in previous deployment.

    Wednesday - problems with network routing on iris-data cloud .

        Creating a network, subnet, router and VM instance using command line
        script results in a broken network configuration.

        Inbound and outbound access to external public internet is blocked.

        Creating a network, subnet, router and VM instance using Horizon GUI
        results in a working network.

        No problems with access to/from the  public internet.

        Resorted to saving the network, subnet, router and VM details as JSON files
        and using diff to spot the differences (there weren't any).

        Contacted Paul Browne for a second pair of eyes.
        Everything works, no errors.

        I deleted a couple of broken components to tidy things up before
        inviting Paul to take a look.

        Looks like one of the components I deleted was causing the routing
        errors, so by the time Paul looked, everything was working.

    Thursday - back for second attempt at creating the shared secret service.

        Three days lost to broken configurations.
