    Target:

        Thougts and ideas on how to manage K8s clusters and Openstack projects.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Ansible build => bootstrap VM

        During the Ansible build, ${cloudname} is the name of the OS project hosting the bootstrap VM.

            Bootstrap is the host VM for the 'gaiadmp-control' K8s cluster.
            Do we rename it ?

        Install Kind (KubernetesINDocker)

            dnf install -y golang
            export GOBIN=/opt/go/bin
            mkdir -p "${GOBIN}"
            export PATH=${PATH}:${GOBIN}
            go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.19.0

        Create a Kind (Kubernetes-IN-Docker) cluster with the ClusterAPI tools installed.
        TODO Add this as an Ansible step.

            clustername=gaiadmp-control

            kubecfgpath=/opt/aglais/kubeconfig
            kubecfgfile=${kubecfgpath:?}/${clustername}.yml

            kind create cluster \
                --name "${clustername:?}" \
                --kubeconfig "${kubecfgfile:?}"

            kubectl cluster-info \
                --kubeconfig "${kubecfgfile:?}"


        clusterctl init --infrastructure openstack





    Metadata for the target cluster contains the Openstack endpoint and credentials.
    TODO Create a named clouds.yaml for each project.

        helm upgrade "${clustername:?}" ....
            --values "${projectname:?}-clouds.yaml

    ClusterAPI tools call out to the target Openstack project and create the cluster resources.
    Optional settings include public floating address for the kubectl endpoint and load balancer.

    The Kind cluster can manage multiple K8s clusters on multiple different Openstack projects, creating separate set of resources (VMs) for each K8s cluster,
