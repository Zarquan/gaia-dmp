    #
    # Unable to create bootstrap node
    #   Could not find image Fedora-34.1.2
    #

    #
    # Tried using CoreOS image
    # Issues:
    # 1. The way that metadata is passed into CoreOS doesn't handle multi-line SSH keys.
    #    In the long term, we can add multiple keys one at a time.
    #    For now, we can just add a single key.
    # 2. CoreOS uses a different package manager.
    #    So all the Ansible calls to dnf will have to be changed.
    #    https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/administrator-handbook/
    #    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/rpm_ostree_pkg_module.html
    # 3. Basically. CoreOS is designed to create an image using a builder, and then making that available in a repository.
    #    Build the image in one step rather than incrementally add packages.
    #    Long term this would be better. Short term it is a "Â£$%^&*(0@~
