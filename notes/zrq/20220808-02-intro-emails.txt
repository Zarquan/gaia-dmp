Dear <researcher>

Welcome to the GaiaDMp project.

Your new account has been created

    User name :
    Pass phrase :

Please note both the the username and pass phrase are case sensitive.

The front page shows a folder of public example notebooks and a folder for your own notebooks.

The public examples demonstrate how to apply a number of different analyses methods using the Gaia data. These will be updated and extended by the Gaia DMp team as we learn more.

We have set the permissions to enable you to open the editor view and see the code for each cell. We ask you not to modify the top level public examples as these are a shared resource.

Each user has a folder under "/Users" for your own notebooks.
To get you started we have included a copy of the example notebooks for you to edit and experiment with.

In addition each user is given 2 directories on the file-system for their own use.
Each user gets a 1Gbyte home directory, "/home/{username}", which you can use to store private information like passwords and authentication tokens.
Each user is also given 10Gbytes of space on the shared file-system at /user/{username}, which is for storing the results of your analyses.

Have fun experimenting. If you have any issues please contact us via the support email address, <gaiadmp-support@roe.ac.uk>, and we will be happy to help.

Cheers,
-- Dave Morris
