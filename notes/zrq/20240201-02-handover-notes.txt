# -----------------------------------------------------

    We have four Openstack projects on the Arcus cloud at Cambridge.

        gaia-red
        gaia-green
        gaia-blue
        gaia-data

    The gaia-data project is used to store permanent data, including the Gaia DR3 science data, user home directories and user data directories.
    A VM in the gaia-data project stores the user account details, including user names, Unix uid and password hash.
    We do not store any unhashed passwords.
    Access to the data VM is via public ssh key.

    The three colours, gaia-red, green and blue are used for development and deployment.
    We cycle through the colours, updating the DNS records to swap the current live service.
    Using a combination of A records in the gaia-dmp.uk domain, registered through LowCostNames (LCN) and a set of CNAME records managed in DuckDNS.
