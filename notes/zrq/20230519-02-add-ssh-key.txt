    Target:

        Add a public ssh key to a user's account.
        This is the first time I've done this, so I'm doing on a test system first.
        Using the test deployment created in prev notes.
            20230519-01-workshop-users.txt

    Result:

        Success, key added to the test system.
        Now we need to apply the same change to the live systen.

    Update:

        Actually, this didn't do what I expected.

        I thought this would update the user's home directory on the tests system,
        and I could check the changes worked before I applied them to the live system.

        What I didn't remember was a live user's home directory is a network mount of a CephFS share.

        The user's home directory on the test system IS THE SAME FILESYSTEM as the user's home directory on the live system.

        So making the change via the test system also changed the files on the live system.

        The Zeppelin notebook directory is not shared between deployments.
        So using a test system to make changes to the notebooks is a good idea.

        A test users home directory is not shared between deployments.
        So if I had run this test on a test user it would have been fine.

        A live users home directory is shared between deployments.
        So any changes on any system will affect all deployments.

        TL;DR; If you are testing something, use a test user account, not a live user account.
        Even if it is on a separate test deplyment.
