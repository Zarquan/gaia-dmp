# Investigating issue with Live service
# Symptoms: All cells running very slow


# --------------------------------
# Check connection to worker nodes

  ssh worker01  - hangs
  ssh worker02  - hangs
  ssh worker03  - hangs
  ssh worker04  - works



# (While in our meeting, worker01 recovered, and was accessible again)



# --------------------------------
# Check Yarn UI

# Setup Tunnel
ssh -L '8088:master01:8080' fedora@zeppelin.aglais.uk


# Open local browser at: http://localhost:8088


# One application running
# 94.2% Usage
# Running Containers: 6

# Total available: 
# 84GB Memory
# VCores Total: 26 
# VCores Used: 6


# After investigating the SPARK UI:
# Lots of failed tasks



# --------------------------------
# Check Prometheus

# Setup Tunnel
ssh -L '3001:monitor:3000' fedora@zeppelin.aglais.uk


# Open local browser at: http://localhost:3001


# ----------------------------------------
# Create Prometheus Server Data source:
 - First Create a new Data source for our Prometheus server. (Main page, click "Create your first datasource", then select "Prometheus")
   - Enter the URL as  "http://localhost:9090" and click Save
 

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Create Dashboard for viewing our Node Exporter (worker node)
 - Click + and then "Import"
 - In the "Grafana".com Dashboard Input, enter "405"
 - After the "Node Exporter Server Metrics" Template loads, enter the Prometheus server we created
 - Dashboard shows up with metrics of the Node Exporter on the worker node 


# First thing I see, is that worker02 doesn't show up in the list of available nodes to select
# Select the 3 worker nodes and set the timeframe to "Last 6 Hours"

# Observations
   - Only worker 04 shows the number of cores (13)
   - We see a big spike in almost all metrics around 16:00 (When Nigel & Dennis started their meeting)
   - The metrics for both worker01 and worker03 stop at around 16:05
   - At the time of the "crash", both have only about 1Gb Free Memory
   - Cached memory on all worker nodes spikes up to about 2-5 Gb
     - On worker03, it goes back down to 327Mb before crashing
     - On worker04, similar
     - On worker01 memory goes to about 1.50Gb before crashing
   - Disk Space used doesn't seem to change at all.
      - Only about a usage % jump of about 8 on /mnt/local/vdb on worker04
   - Disk Throughput spikes at the time of the crash:
     - worker03 is mostly read dominated
     - worker01 has mostly read # of IOps, but write dominated disk throughput 


# Another useful dashboard is: 1860
# Import that and see if we can observe anything else
 
     - Worker03 was at about 68% CPU Usage and 99% Mem usage when it crashed


# --------------------------------
# Restart Nodes

# In Openstack UI Restart all worker nodes
# Shutdown / Start Instance



# --------------------------------
# fedora@master01
# Restart Nodes

# --------------------------------
# Check Yarn UI again

# We now see 168 Gb total available Memory
# All 4 nodes are active again
# 13 VCores per node
# We can ssh into all 4 nodes again
