        Debug JobManager issue for upgraded Zeppelin (0.10.0)
          With the newer deploy of Zeppelin, after clicking the JobManager UI, all we see is a Loading notification, but nothing shows up, and we see an empty list of Interpreters.
 
    Result:

       Success



# Try a new deploy of Zeppelin 0.10.0 from scratch
# In a new Zeppelin installation under the Zeppelin config file (conf/zeppelin-site.xml), there is the following entry:

..

<property>
  <name>zeppelin.jobmanager.enable</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>The Job tab in zeppelin page seems not so useful instead it cost lots of memory and affect the performance.
  Disable it can save lots of memory</description>
</property>

..


	" The Job tab in zeppelin page seems not so useful instead it cost lots of memory and affect the performance.
	  Disable it can save lots of memory " 



# After enabling it, by setting it to true, the JobManager UI works again

# This seems odd, I would expect that disabling it would hide the button that links to it, however this is not what happens, instead we get what looks like a bug, where the button is there, but the page it # takes us to does not work

# For now lets set that to enabled, and think about if we want to disable later. One of the reasons for leaving it enabled is user expectations, as the alternative looks like a bug to the user.
# However on the other side the comment
