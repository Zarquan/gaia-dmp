# Setting up Alerting for Gaia DMP

# Use Webhook URL for GDMP Slack APP
This can be found in the gaia-dmp variables (secrets) at:

        https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/settings/variables/actions 
        variable name: GDMP_SLACK_TOKEN
        
# Create Notification Channel in Grafana, using the Webhook URL        

# Import dashboard with Alerting enabled:
   
   Use: deployments/common/grafana/node-exporter-v20230606-1686055906502-alerting.json

# Setup Alert to use Notification Channel
   Edit the Disk usage widget on any of the nodes, navigate to the Alert tab, set the notification channel to the one we created
      You may get asked to delete a previous Alert with the wrong UID. I think this refers to the UID of the Notification channel which is now different. I'm not sure what the best approach is here, and how to reuse notification channels and automate the process. In any case it should be fine to delete the old one and use the new Channel
          
Generally this is not an automated process, and needs work to get there.
