Target:

    Document various info I've discovered on sharing notebooks and running shared notebooks



# 1

For public notebooks, like the ones in Public Examples, when one users starts running the notebook, any other user who has the notebook opened will be able to watch the progress.
There is also a small button at the top menu, which shows how many users are actively watching this notebook.
Note that this is the case when the notebook is in "Collaboration" mode. (See top menu) It is likely that changing that to "Personal Mode" may have a different effect, but not sure yet..


# 2

Note visibility and read/write access can be changes by the user (top right lock button)
Only note owners can change this.


# 3

Users cannot create Notebook paths that already exist.
For example, I've created a notebook under '/Experiments/stv/test1', and gaiauser was not able to create a notebook with that path & name

Error was:

"""
Failed to create note.
NotePathAlreadyExistsException: Note '/Experiments/stv/test1' existed
"""


# 4

By default, notebooks and the directories that they may create are private by default. i.e. In the previous example, I created /Experiments/stv/test1 as "stv". If I login as 'gaiauser', I do not see the 'stv' folder 


# 5

When clicking the note permissions, we get to select owner, write, run and read access, and by typing we get a selection of existing users from which we can choose who to add
For example, for public notebooks, if we set access to read run, then they can read and run, but not change any cells. It seems to be however that only one user can run a notebook at a time?



# 6 

In personal mode, when one user edits the notebook and runs, the output is based on the edited version, but it reverts back to the original after.
Doesn't happen in Collaboration mode


# 7

You need write access to be able to clone a note


# 8

Only owners can change the mode & permission of a notebook
